**Deidril's Starfinder 1 PDF Import v2.12a**

Scoured Stars Test Import

This module is a test version of the starfinder pdf import, under the name 'SCOURED STARS - TEST IMPORT'

The import of the Scoured Stars AP is too much work for a single man, so I've decided to call to contribution to
produce maps and compendiums. This module is a side version of the pdf import module where i will integrate
community's works. Once the import is complete, it will be added to the standard module.

This module can't be found in foundry's module directory. You must download it manually by giving the
url https://github.com/deidril/sfrpg-pdf-en-import/releases/latest/download/module.json .

Version 2.12a : 
The module imports: 
- images and tokens for pages 1-142 (adventure 1-7 )
- journals for pages 8-11

You will find the list of contributions looking for a worker on the discord channel https://discord.gg/XryTbnxWVq channel #contributions

When you import the pdf, you will have a waiting time at progress 93/96 of a few minutes to cover the exploration of the unhandled images.

The module will import images in the foundry data directory ~/Data/helyx/scoured-stars directory. Contributors working on maps must 
use the files that can be found in ~/Datas/scoured-stars/scenes. Images are named with the format scene-<adventure><map>.webp . 
Therefore image scene-5b.webp is the image for the scene B of adventure 5.
