**Deidril's Scoured Stars Test Import - v3.12.4**

Manifest : https://github.com/deidril/sfrpg-pdf-en-import/releases/download/3.12.4/module.json

This is a test module dedicated to building the import of the Scoured Stars AP.
Delete manually the previous install of this module and start over from a fresh world.

Import status : 

- Journals, Actors and Scenes up to adv #4 are covered
- Fixed Some inversed maps (are there still some ?)
- There are missing tokens on scene 4-c. Will be fixed in next release

For the next scoured stars release :
- I've a couple of small imports to do for the normal modules of pf2e and starfinder, so there will be a week off scoured stars
- I'm working on the module programming part to support hexagonal tokens. So that's additional days off importing scoured stars
